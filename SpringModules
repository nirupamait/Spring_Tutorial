What is Spring Ioc Container?
It is pre-defined module given by Spring for doing below things::
Create object
Inject object
Hold object in memory


We need to give beans information and configuration to Container

ApplicationContext which extends BeanFactory is an interface and represent our container.

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext

AnnotationConfixApplicationContext

FileSystemApplicationXMLApplicationContext


IoC Container:: creates objects and injects dependencies at runtime automatically.


Dependency Injection can be done in two ways::
Setter Injection
Constructor Injection

Configuration File:: Where we need to declare its beans and its dependencies.

DataType Dependencies(Primitive)
Byte,short, char, int , long

2)Collection type:: List,Set,Property,Map

3)Reference type::object


Property Injection using p schema and using value attribute::
<bean clas="com. " name:"student1" p:studenTid="2434" p:studentName="Aartsingh" p:studentAddress="Delhi"/>
